# xcodecleaner
Like any other ios dev, the amount of cleans, resets and rebuilds I have to do per day is enormous.
Since I'm lazy I've decided to create this simple bash script to do that at once.
I have little knowledge of shell scripting, so this is what I've put together after some browsing around.
Enjoy!

## What will it do?
Delete all the derived data and reset all the simulators.

## How to use it?
Simply run it from terminal in the same folder:
`./xcodecleaner.sh`

If it complains about the permissions try to give it executing permission:
`chmod +x xcodecleaner.sh`
